# pandas-challenge
In this challenge I used the Pandas Python Module to splice data into ways to give perspectives on hot selling items and which players purchased the most items in games.

Within this data set, I noticed three distinct trends:
  1. At most, players made 6 purchases within the game. 
  2. Typically, females tended to spend more money on this game. 
  3. The item that sold the most was priced at $4.19, suggesting that this could be an amount that most players are willing to spend in game.
